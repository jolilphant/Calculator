You are going to make a simple calculator program that has the basic arithmetic functions built in.

You should get 3 inputs from the user:

input 1: what mathematical operation is being performed.

input 2: the first number in the equation (could be float)

input 3: the second number in the equation(could be float) 

Your calculator should include:

addition
subtraction
division (floating point)
multiplication
exponents
 

your output should include the formula as well as the solution for example something like this:

5 + 4 = 9

Your program should also implement a while loop so it keeps running, allowing the user to not have to re run your program each time

they use it.

 

*** bonus points:

get a number of floating point digits to round the answer to

handle user input issues like non numbers and/or if the user puts in a zero for the denominator on division.

add roots or other additional mathematical processes.
